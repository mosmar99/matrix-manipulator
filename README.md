Arrays, Strings and Modules with Pointers and Memory Management

# General
The intended learning outcomes of this assignment, includes using arrays, strings, modules, pointers and dynamic memory management. The assignment is organized into 3 problems, where the first two problems involve creating a library of two modules, and the final problem uses the library (two modules) to create a main program.

# Problem 1: The intArray Module (intarray.h, intarray.c)

# Problem 2: The fMatrix Module (fmatrix.h, fmatrix.c)

# Problem 3: The Main Program
